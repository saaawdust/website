            <h2>So yeah, that's me.</h2>
            <p>Okay so basically I'm just some guy from Britain who's had a weirdly interesting life when I think about
                it. Here's the stuff that matters:</p>

            <h2>The name thing</h2>
            <p>So "Saw" actually came from this dumb game I made up in primary school. Remember when you'd just invent
                games at your school break? Mine was this weird tag/horror hybrid where I played this robot with a saw arm (kinda
                like Robby from Piggy in Roblox, but this was before that existed).</p>

            <p>When I finally got Discord, my friend was like "you should just go by Saw" and it stuck. The "wastaken"
                part got added later because... well, "Saw" was already taken. Original, I know.</p>

            <h2>MY TONSILS!!??!?!?!</h2>
            <p>Oh and I've had my tonsils removed THREE TIMES because they keep growing back? Apparently that's not
                supposed to happen? Doctors are always weirdly fascinated when they find out. It's my weird party trick
                I guess.</p>

            <h2>EVEN MORE YAP!?!</h2>
            <p>I'm really into programming and stuff - like if you start talking about space or science, I'll probably ner out way too hard icl...</p>
            <p>my brain essentially has 2 modes: "Wait, I actually understand quantum physics?" and "How did I forget how doors work?" There is no in-between!</p>

            <p>Anyway that's me - just a normal guy with a weird name and mutant tonsils. If any of this made you go
                "huh, neat" then we'll probably get along.</p>
